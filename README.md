## Issues with ReFi

1. Businesses face minimal profitability with most pressure coming from international policies, lacking motivation.
2. Lack of transparency in businesses' low-carbon actions for users, with carbon credits not publicly disclosed, making quantification difficult.
3. Limited liquidity, providing insufficient rewards for users.

## Economic Model

**For Businesses:**

- Expenses
  - Event hosting costs
  - User incentive expenses
- Revenue
  - Revenue from promotions
  - Offsetting corporate carbon footprint
  - Reputation (establishing credit scoring, future use of zk for company privacy data processing)
  - Project financing releases

**For Customers:**

- Expenses
  - Paying tokens to participate in company-sponsored activities
  - Donating to new projects for their preferred businesses
- Revenue
  - Completing activities to earn rewards (future use of ERC404 protocol to increase gamification)
    - Reward Form 1: NFTs tradable in the market
    - Reward Form 2: Tokens (both self-spent and business-rewarded)
  - For donated businesses, receiving airdrop-like rewards after project releases
    - From users who haven't completed the business projects
